## üîê Security Verification

### Database Security
- [ ] OTP codes are NOT stored in plain text anywhere visible
- [ ] Foreign key constraint exists on `otp_codes.user_id`
- [ ] Indexes exist on email, otp_code, expires_at
- [ ] Passwords are hashed in users/staff tables

### OTP Security
Run in phpMyAdmin after generating an OTP:
```sql
-- Check OTP in database
SELECT * FROM otp_codes ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
```

- [ ] OTP is stored in database
- [ ] `expires_at` is ~10 minutes in future
- [ ] `is_used` is 0 initially
- [ ] After verification, `is_used` becomes 1

### Password Security
- [ ] Passwords in database are hashed (start with `$2y$`)
- [ ] Cannot see plain text passwords anywhere
- [ ] `password_verify()` used in login (check `index.php`)

### Session Security
During OTP verification:
```php
// These should be set in session:
$_SESSION['otp_verification_pending']
$_SESSION['otp_email']
$_SESSION['pending_user_id']
$_SESSION['pending_staff_id']
$_SESSION['pending_username']
$_SESSION['pending_role']
```

- [ ] Session variables set correctly
- [ ] After successful verification, pending variables cleared
- [ ] Normal session variables (`user_id`, `role`, etc.) restored
