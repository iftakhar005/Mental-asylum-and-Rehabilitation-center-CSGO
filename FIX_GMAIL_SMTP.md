## üî¥ CRITICAL: Your App Password Might Be Wrong

I noticed your app password is: `qjhkezrzkymqaing` (16 characters)

**This might not be the correct password!** Here's how to fix it:

## ‚úÖ STEP-BY-STEP FIX (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Verify 2-Step Verification is ON

1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/security
2. Scroll to "Signing in to Google"
3. Click "2-Step Verification"
4. **Make sure it says "ON"**
5. If it says "OFF", click "Get Started" and set it up

---

### Step 2: Generate a FRESH App Password

1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
2. If you see old app passwords, you can delete them
3. Click "Select app" ‚Üí Choose **"Mail"**
4. Click "Select device" ‚Üí Choose **"Other (Custom name)"**
5. Type: **"MindCare 2FA"**
6. Click **"Generate"**
7. You'll see a 16-character password like: `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`
8. **IMPORTANT**: Copy it WITHOUT spaces: `abcdefghijklmnop`

### Step 3: Update phpmailer_config.php

Open: `E:\XAMPP\htdocs\CSGO\Mental-asylum-and-Rehabilitation-center-CSGO\phpmailer_config.php`

Find line 17 and replace with your NEW password:

```php
define('SMTP_PASSWORD', 'YOUR_NEW_16_CHAR_PASSWORD');  // Paste here, NO SPACES
```

**Example** (use YOUR password, not this):
```php
define('SMTP_PASSWORD', 'abcdefghijklmnop');
```

---

### Step 4: Test Email Sending

Open this URL:
```
http://localhost/CSGO/Mental-asylum-and-Rehabilitation-center-CSGO/test_smtp_detailed.php
```

Click "Test SMTP Connection"

**If successful, you'll see:**
- ‚úì Connection Successful
- ‚úì STARTTLS Ready
- ‚úì TLS Encryption Enabled
- ‚úì‚úì‚úì AUTHENTICATION SUCCESSFUL ‚úì‚úì‚úì

**If it fails, you'll see exactly what's wrong!**

---

## üîß ALTERNATIVE: Use Port 465 (SSL instead of TLS)

If port 587 doesn't work, try SSL on port 465:

Edit `phpmailer_config.php`:

```php
define('SMTP_HOST', 'smtp.gmail.com');
define('SMTP_PORT', 465);  // Change from 587 to 465
define('SMTP_USERNAME', 'iftakharmajumder@gmail.com');
define('SMTP_PASSWORD', 'YOUR_APP_PASSWORD_HERE');
```

Then modify `otp_functions.php` to use SSL instead of TLS.

## üö® Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Spaces in password** ‚ùå
   - Gmail shows: `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`
   - You must use: `abcdefghijklmnop` (no spaces!)

2. **Using regular password** ‚ùå
   - Don't use your Gmail login password
   - Must use App Password (16 characters)

3. **2-Step Verification not enabled** ‚ùå
   - You CAN'T create App Passwords without it
   - Enable it first at: https://myaccount.google.com/security

4. **Wrong email address** ‚ùå
   - Make sure SMTP_USERNAME matches your Gmail: `iftakharmajumder@gmail.com`

- [ ] Updated phpmailer_config.php line 17

## ‚ö° FASTEST FIX (If Above Doesn't Work)

I can modify your system to use PHP's `mail()` function with a local SMTP server.

Or install **Papercut SMTP** for Windows:
- Download: https://github.com/ChangemakerStudios/Papercut-SMTP/releases
- Install and run
- It catches all emails sent by PHP
- Perfect for localhost testing!

**Which do you want to try first?**

A) Generate new App Password and update config (recommended)
B) Use Papercut SMTP for localhost
C) Use different SMTP service (not Gmail)
