## 🎯 Quick Access

### Step 1: Setup Database Tables (One-Time)

**Option A: Run the setup script**
```
http://localhost/CSGO/Mental-asylum-and-Rehabilitation-center-CSGO/simple_setup_aggregation_monitoring.php
```

**Option B: Import SQL (if you prefer command line)**
```bash
cd e:\XAMPP\htdocs\CSGO\Mental-asylum-and-Rehabilitation-center-CSGO
mysql -u root asylum_db < aggregation_monitoring_schema.sql
```

### Step 2: Access Audit Trail

1. Login as **admin** or **chief-staff**
2. Navigate to: 
   ```
   http://localhost/CSGO/Mental-asylum-and-Rehabilitation-center-CSGO/audit_trail.php
   ```
3. Or click **"Audit Trail"** from the admin dashboard sidebar

## 📊 What You Can See

### Tab 1: Data Access Logs
- Every SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operation
- Who accessed what, when
- Number of records affected
- Bulk operation flags
- Sensitive data flags

### Tab 2: Modification History
- Field-level changes (old → new values)
- Who made the change
- When it was changed
- Why it was changed (if reason provided)

### Tab 3: Bulk Alerts
- Operations exceeding thresholds
- Alert levels (INFO, WARNING, CRITICAL)
- Investigation status

---

## 🔄 How It Works

### Automatic Logging

**Every time you use these functions, logging happens automatically:**

```php
// This logs the SELECT operation
$patients = $securityManager->secureSelect(
    "SELECT * FROM patients WHERE status = ?",
    ['active'],
    's'
);

// This logs the UPDATE operation
$securityManager->secureExecute(
    "UPDATE patients SET status = ? WHERE id = ?",
    [$new_status, $patient_id],
    'si'
);

// This logs UPDATE + tracks field changes
$securityManager->secureExecuteWithHistory(
    "UPDATE staff SET role = ? WHERE staff_id = ?",
    [$new_role, $staff_id],
    'ss',
    "Role change requested by admin"  // ← Change reason
);
```

## 📋 Database Tables Created

When you run the setup, these tables are created:

1. `data_access_logs` - All database access operations
2. `data_modification_history` - Field-level change tracking
3. `bulk_operation_alerts` - Bulk operation monitoring
4. `role_data_permissions` - Role-based access control
5. `approval_workflows` - Approval configuration
6. `approval_requests` - Pending approvals
7. `approval_actions` - Approval history
8. `user_session_monitoring` - Session tracking

---

## 🔍 Quick Test

### Test if it's working:

1. **Login** to your application
2. **Make a change** (e.g., update a patient record)
3. **Open Audit Trail**: `audit_trail.php`
4. **Check** - You should see your action logged!

## 📱 Admin Dashboard Integration

The Audit Trail has been added to your admin dashboard:

**Location:** Security & Compliance section
**Icon:** 📋 Clipboard List
**Link:** Audit Trail

2. Modifications - Field changes
3. Bulk Alerts - Security warnings

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Table doesn't exist"

**Solution:**
Run the setup script:
```
http://localhost/.../simple_setup_aggregation_monitoring.php
```

### Problem: "No logs appearing"

**Check:**
1. Are tables created? Run: `SHOW TABLES LIKE '%log%';` in phpMyAdmin
2. Are you using `secureSelect/secureExecute`? Direct `$conn->query()` won't log
3. Are you logged in? Logs require active user session

### Problem: "Access denied"

**Solution:**
- Only **admin** and **chief-staff** roles can access audit trail
- Check `$_SESSION['role']`
